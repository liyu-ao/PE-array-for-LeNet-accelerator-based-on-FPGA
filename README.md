# PE-array-for-LeNet-accelerator-based-on-FPGA
### This is a 4*5 PE array for LeNet accelerator based on FPGA.
### The code is improved based on zhan6841's verilog code for LeNet.(https://github.com/zhan6841/FPGA-Accelerator-for-AES-LeNet-VGG16)
### The speed of the accelerator is greatly increased by using PE array instead of single PE.
